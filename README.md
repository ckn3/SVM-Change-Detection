# A two-stage method for spectral–spatial classification of hyperspectral images

This code is an implementation of the two-stage method, where the first stage is a \nu-SVM and the second stage is a L1 & L2-norm optimization that denoised the prediction.
In general, this code can be used as a semisupervised classifier that is capable for high-dimensional datasets.
- The code is written in MATLAB, and you need a 64-bit Windows computer to run the code.
